# Serina UI Test Cases

This file records console-based test cases for Serina after Levels 1-8, A-enums, and storage features. Each test lists the user input sequence and the key output that should appear.

## How To Use

Compile and run Serina, then enter the inputs shown under each test case.

From the project root, the terminal commands are:

```bash
javac -d out src/main/java/serina/*.java
java -cp out serina.Serina
```

The exact divider lines are omitted below to keep the tests readable. The messages should still appear inside Serina's usual response boxes.

## Level 1 (Echo)

### Test 1.1 - Greet And Exit

Input:

```text
bye
```

Expected key output:

```text
Hello! I'm Serina
What can I do for you?
Type help to see the available commands.
Bye. Hope to see you again soon!
```

Note: The early echo behavior was later replaced by task-specific command parsing. After Level 5, unknown commands are handled as errors instead of being echoed or added.
